# Introduction :spades:
Welcome to the Malware-Craftsmanship repository. The purpose of this repository is to share insights and learnings in the realm of malware development. While I am not an expert, my goal is to contribute to the community by sharing what I am learning, especially insights that could be valuable in red-team engagements.

# Why C/C++ & ASM? :computer:
You might wonder why the focus on low-level programming languages such as C, C++, and Assembly. The reason is straightforward: power and precision. Delving into low-level programming compels an understanding of memory management, safe programming practices, and efficiency in code writing. To stay ahead in cybersecurity, grasping the fundamentals of low-level programming is not just an advantage—it's a necessity. Plus, it's where the real fun begins!

# Compiling & Running :wrench:
This repository contains only the source code—no precompiled binaries. All development is conducted in Visual Studio, leveraging its powerful features for building and debugging:

# Building: Use Ctrl+B to build your projects.
Running: Press F5 to run your applications.
Command Line Arguments: To run executables that require command line arguments, use `Ctrl+`` to open the Developer PowerShell terminal and provide the necessary arguments to your executable.

# Resources :notebook:
Below are some invaluable resources for anyone interested in malware development and low-level programming:
