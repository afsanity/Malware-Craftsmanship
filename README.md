*Disclaimer*: I am not responsible if you choose to use this for malicious intent, this repository is strictly for educational purposes. 

# Introduction 
I am creating this repo becasue I believe it is essential to share what you are working on and learning in the realm of malware development. I am by no means an expert in malware development -  just a guy sharing what he is learning and could potentially use in red-team engagements. 

# C/C++ & ASM 
You are probably wondering, why am I choosing to write all this code in low-level? Well, the answer is simple, it is powerful. Learning low-level will force you to understand memory management, safe programming practices, and how to write code that is efficient. I truly believe that to be ahead of the curve in cyber, you HAVE to at least understand low-level. Also, this is where all the fun is!
